<br>
Tested with 7-ZIP versions of: 15.05, 16.04, 19.00, 20.00 Alpha and 21.04 Beta, all of it works fine.<br>
<br>
Original program was updated for 7-Zip version 9.23 alpha, quote: "7zTM 2.1.1 Hotfix, a special version for 7-Zip 9.23 alpha".<br>
But, for example, it does not support the "squashfs" file-type.<br>
<br>
I removed the command-line program written in .Net framework, my version don't need it anymore. Now it works from Windows XP until Windows 10 without the requirements of installing .NET framework.<br>
