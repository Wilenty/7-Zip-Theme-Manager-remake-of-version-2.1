Tested with 7-ZIP versions of: 15.05, 16.04, 19.00 and 20.00 Alpha, all of it works fine.<br>
<br>
Original program was updated for 7-Zip version 9.23 alpha, quote: "7zTM 2.1.1 Hotfix, a special version for 7-Zip 9.23 alpha".<br>
But, for example, it does not support "squashfs" file-type.<br>
<br>
I removed the command line program written in .Net framework, my version don't need it anymore. Now it works from Windows XP until Windows 10 without the requirements of installing .NET framework.<br>
